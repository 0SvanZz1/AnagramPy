# AnagramPy

AnagramPy is a basic anagram game made with Python. The user's objective is to search for possible words based on the displayed letters.

The game has the following "rules":
  - You can only miss 5 times, otherwise the game will end
  - The anagram is shuffled everytime you miss or find a word
  - The word database won't consider words with special characters, so avoid using it

## Getting Started

### Starting the game

First you'll need to clone the repository and access the project's directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0SvanZz1/AnagramPy.git
cd AnagramPy/
```

Then, to start the game, you should execute the `anagram.py` file using Python:
```bash
python3 anagram.py
```
